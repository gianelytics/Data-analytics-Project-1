### 📄 Content:

- A comparative table with the total of deaths reported from COVID-19 per 100 thousand inhabitants, the total of "excess deaths" per 100 thousand inhabitants, and the difference between both figures, by country.
- A chart that shows the data from the above table in the form of a bar graph.
- A chart for each country that shows the comparison of the evolution in time of the reported COVID-19 deaths vs. the calculation of "excess deaths" week by week.
- A chart for each country that shows the same variables as the previous point, but accumulated over time.
